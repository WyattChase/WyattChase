How can I add my GitHub profile? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
Create an issue, with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image URL, this will be needed in the next step)

Fork the project, using the top right corner button, that states fork

Create a file named your-username.json in the directory profiles with the following content.

Your entry should be similar to this example:

{
  "image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/91057573-48531300-e61f-11ea-9e13-2d7384e42000.png",
